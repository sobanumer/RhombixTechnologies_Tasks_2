# RhombixTechnologies_Tasks_2
A sentiment classification project using machine learning (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and an Ensemble) trained on a synthetic dataset with three classes: Positive, Negative, and Neutral
## ðŸ“Œ Task 2: Sentiment Analysis

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal  
Build a machine learning model to classify text into **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** sentiments.

### ðŸ“Š Dataset  
- Text dataset containing labeled samples for 3 classes: **Positive, Negative, Neutral**.  
- Preprocessed with **TF-IDF vectorization**.

### ðŸ›  Method  
- Data preprocessing: tokenization, cleaning, and vectorization using **TF-IDF**.  
- Trained multiple classifiers:  
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **XGBoost**  
- Created an **ensemble model** combining predictions for improved performance.  
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### âœ… Results  
- Achieved **~83% accuracy** on the test set.  
- Example predictions:  
  - `"I love this product! Totally recommend it."` â†’ **Positive**  
  - `"This is the worst experience I've ever had."` â†’ **Negative**  
  - `"Not sure how I feel about this."` â†’ **Neutral**
